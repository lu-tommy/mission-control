# 2026-01-30

## Key Events
- Created MEMORY.md, TOOLS.md as core reference files
- Fixed MAG7 bot database logging bug (added `insert_signal()` call)
- Fixed Kalshi risk management bug (duplicate method name)
- Fixed weekend position spam (added dedup flag)

## Lessons Learned
- Python method overloading silently overwrites - use unique names
- Always check actual file content before assuming bugs
- Dedup repeated system messages to avoid user frustration

## Trading Bot Status
- MAG7 v10: Running, paper trading
- Kalshi: Critical bugs remain - NOT safe for live trading
