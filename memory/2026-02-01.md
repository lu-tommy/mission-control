- Model preference: When Opus 4.5 plan usage is exhausted, automatically switch to GLM 4.7 and notify Tommy
- Current model: GLM 4.7 (already switched)
- Voice chat fix: Pass message directly to `sessions_spawn` without wrapper - GLM 4.7 now responds correctly
- Set up .learnings/ directory for self-improvement (LEARNINGS.md, ERRORS.md)
- Added self-improvement workflow to AGENTS.md
- Added weekly learning review cron (Saturdays 6pm)
- Updated TOOLS.md with voice chat settings
